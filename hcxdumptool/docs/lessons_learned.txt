Lessons learned (to be continued)
--------------

a beautiful status output make the attack tool slow and sluggish

too many features make an attack slow and sluggish

response time behavior becomes very bad on big ringbuffers

transmitting too many packets makes a channel busy

a Raspberry Pi is not able to handle more than one interface at the same time

multiple interfaces interfere with each other

pselect doesn't like to be interrupted by another timer

epoll is a better solution than pselect

timerfd in combination with epoll is easier to handle than comparing timestamps

active monitor require to set virtual MAC on interface - that is too slow

setting a short preamble in radiotap header is ignored on tx

entire AUTHENTICATION process should be done using a low data rate of 1.0 Mb/s and a low bandwidth

there are (much) better ways than injecting stupid DEAUTHENTICATION frames to disconnect a CLIENT

the most useful EAPOL frame is an EAPOL M2 frame(!)

NL80211 provide a lot more features than WIRLESS EXTENSIONS

NL80211 / RTNETLINK protocol can be used without libnl dependency

sharing the interface (e.g. iw phy phy1 interface add mon0 type monitor) is counterproductive

TX power is (completely) meaningless - RX sensitivity and a good antenna is all

it is a thousand times faster using a Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) than walking through endless filter lists
